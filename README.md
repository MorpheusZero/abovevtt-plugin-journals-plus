# abovevtt-plugin-journals-plus
An AboveVTT Plugin that adds Journal Integration

### MVP
- Ability to edit the title.
- View titles of journal entries on the list view.
- Store journal entries per character
   - Issue now is that if you load up the page and plugin with a different character you will see all entries for all characters
- Links to repo
- Repo Name and code consistency
   - Journal(s) Plus references
   - DRY
   - Modularize some pieces so its easier to read and maintain

### Nice To Have
- Rich Text Editor for journal entries (bold, italic, links, etc.).
   - Instead of an EDIT button on the list view it should be a VIEW button--then when you open up the modal it should load and show the entry with the rich text rendered and on the modal there should be an EDIT button and if you press it it will load the text in the input box instead of the Rich Text view.
